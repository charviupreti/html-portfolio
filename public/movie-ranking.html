<h3>3 idiots</h3>
<p>
  3 Idiots is my all-time favorite movie. It beautifully delves into the world
  of engineering, handling sensitive topics like mental health and the
  challenges faced by students in a profound yet straightforward manner. It
  carries a deep and meaningful message throughout.
</p>
<h3>Inside Out</h3>
<p>
  "Inside Out" is another fantastic movie that delves into human emotions. It
  beautifully explains why experiencing all emotions, even those like disgust
  and sadness, is essential. It also highlights the idea that emotions aren't
  just one thing or another; they can be a blend of many feelings.

<h3>Wall - E</h3>
<p>
  Another Pixar epic, how can you not like a touching story? It's a amazing
  masterpiece which conveys a powerful message about environmental
  sustainability and the importance of taking care of our planet. It also delves
  into themes of human emotions like loneliness.
