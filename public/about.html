<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Charvi Upreti.</p>

<p>
  I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering at
  Vellore Institute of Technology. My primary areas of interest revolve around
  Data Analytics and AI-ML. Additionally, I hold a fascination for web
  development. I constantly strive to stay updated with the latest technologies
  and trends in the field to enhance my skills and knowledge.

<p>
  In my free time, I find pleasure in hand lettering. I've also been an active
  participant in the VITeach club at VIT Chennai, which is a student-run social
  outreach club.

<p>
  I'm excited about connecting with individuals who share similar interests.
  Let's collaborate, learn from each other, and create amazing things together!
